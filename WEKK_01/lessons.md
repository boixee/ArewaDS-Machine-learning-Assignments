# Machine Learning

Machine learning automates the process of pattern-discovery by finding meaningful insights from real-world or generated data. ML is a field devoted to understanding and building methods that lets machines "learn"- That is, methods that leverage data to improve the compueter performance on some set of task.

## Notable dates in the history of Machine Learning

* **1763, 1812 Bayes Theorem and its predecessors** :
* **1805 Least Square Theory by French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre** :
* **1913 Markov Chains** :
* **1957 Perceptron** :

## Machine Learning at present
Machine learning is now responsible for the most significant advancement in technology, The world of business, academic activities are currently using machine learning:

* **Analyzing Sales Data**: *Streaming the data*
* **Real-Time Mobile Personalization**: *Promoting the experiance*
* **Fraud Detection**: *Detecting pettern chages*
* **Product Recommendations**: *Customer personalization*
* **Learning Management System**: *Decision-making programs
* **Natural Language Processing**: *Speaking with humans* 

## Machine Learning Fairness
Machine Learning fairness is the process of correcting and eliminating algorithmic bias (of race and ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and class) from machine learning model.
